# Accessibility Code Refractor

## Description

This project was built to develop my understanding of html, css and accessibility best practice as part of a homework task.

The project takes a provided existing website and refractors the code to meet the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
Here is a screenshot of the completed website. Whilst this is no different from the original the page will be much easier to use on a screen reader:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/accessibility-code-refractor-screengrab.png)
